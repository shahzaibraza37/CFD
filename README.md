# Development of a CFD simulation environment for the determination of characteristic stress parameters in an extrusion device -->

A simulation is set up to determine characteristic stress parameters in an
extrusion device, which is seen as future industrial standard in lithium-ion battery slurry
processing. The image of the simulation environment is shown below:
